        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born on a crisp garbage day in April 1983. I was a creative and sleepy child who grew up to be a creative and sleepy adult. I have always wanted to have a career in a creative field, and chose <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> after working at my dad's graphic design company for five years. I learnt so much from the other designers there but most of them started their careers in the age of Letraset and x-acto knives - so off to school I went. </p>
        <p>When I'm not at school you can find me sewing, knitting, reading or working part-time as a server. I live in Little Italy with my partner, our cat Lambic and a basset hound named Blanche. I love learning new creative things and most recently took a stained glass class. Next I would love to learn shoemaking and millinery! But <strong>for now</strong>, I will focus my attention on learning the basics of html... &#128540;</p>

            Would I rather be feared or loved? Easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. â€“<cite>Dwight Schrute</cite></blockquote>
            <p>This is my 1<sup>st</sup> time ever doing <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> although I have experimented with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> on a few websites that I've built in Squarespace. There is no better feeling than when you "get it". I love learning the <em>why</em> of coding.</p>
